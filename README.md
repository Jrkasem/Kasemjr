# [Project 1: VDH survey data analysis](https://github.com/Jrkasem/AK_healtcare_data_portfolio/blob/main/AK%20VDH%20survey%20dataanylsis.ipynb)
This project involves analyzing and visualizing data from a survey related to Tuberculosis (TB) testing, risk factors, and related practices. The code provided uses Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries to perform data analysis and create visualizations based on the survey responses.

# [Project 2: Creating an Emergency Room Dashboard in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ahmed.kasim/viz/AhmedsErvisitDashboard/Dashboard1)
embarked on the journey of creating an Emergency Room Dashboard using Real World Fake Data (RWFD) Emergency Room Data with a profound desire to contribute to the enhancement of healthcare services. Recognizing the critical role emergency rooms play in providing immediate care and saving lives, I aimed to develop a comprehensive visualization tool that could assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions efficiently. By crafting this dashboard, I aspired to empower medical personnel with actionable insights into the patient flow, wait times, medical conditions, and treatment patterns. This project reflects my commitment to leveraging data-driven solutions for real-world challenges and embodies my dedication to supporting the healthcare industry's continuous improvement. Ultimately, my goal was to create a resource that not only facilitates better decision-making but also contributes to optimizing emergency room operations, ultimately benefiting both medical staff and patients in need.

# [Project 3: Clinical Diagnostic Assessment: Calculating Likelihood Ratios for Medical Conditions using SQL](https://github.com/Jrkasem/AK_healtcare_data_portfolio/blob/main/sql%20school%20project.sql)
This SQL project involves performing calculations for likelihood ratios using a temporary table populated with medical data. The data in the temporary table represents diagnostic outcomes for various medical conditions, including True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), False Negatives (FN), and True Negatives (TN). The project's main objective is to calculate different ratios that aid in assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of diagnostic tests for each medical condition.

The code creates a temporary table named "#ICD" with columns for the condition name and the corresponding TP, FP, FN, and TN values. The data is then inserted into this table, representing diagnostic outcomes for different medical conditions.

Subsequently, the calculations for sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) are performed for each condition using SQL queries. Sensitivity and specificity measure the test's ability to correctly identify positive and negative cases, respectively. LR+ and LR- provide insights into how much the diagnostic test changes the odds of having the condition when the test is positive or negative, respectively.

The final SQL query retrieves the calculated values for each condition and likelihood ratio type from the temporary table, applying the necessary formulas. Finally, the temporary table is dropped to clean up the environment.

This project demonstrates the application of SQL in healthcare analytics, specifically in evaluating diagnostic test performance through likelihood ratios. It showcases the importance of accurate and precise data analysis in the medical field to make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.
